I applied, and suddenly got a phone call. Then all of the sudden the phone screams 'FBI Open Up!'. Everything went into a disaster as the FBI Swat team almost destroys the whole library. Then they arrest me for doing drug dealing as the job post is a bait for the fish. I am the fish. I got caught. They take to prison, and they sentence me for 10 years in jail. This is the worst day of my life, and I am unluck for that.
