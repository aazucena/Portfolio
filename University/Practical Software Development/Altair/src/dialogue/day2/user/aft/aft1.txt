I have a feeling that he's a boring teacher so I turn my head and stare out to the window. However, I tried to ignore Mr. Mephistopheles, but I can't. Because he's chill teacher as he explain things in simple words. So I am engage by his prescence, and halfly listen to his lecture about Canadian History. I listen to him religiously till the end of class. And I wonder how I can be like him?
