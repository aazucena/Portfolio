So the answer is... $ans. *wink* *wink* He is just some Liberal Party leader. He led Canada to join NATO in 1949 to fight the spread of Communism, as he had more hatred of communism, and he fear less of the United States. He was neither an idealist nor a bookish intellectual, but an eminently moderate, cautious man and a strong Canadian nationalist. I got this from Wikipedia, and IMI he's an unsound leader that should deserve attention. Pretty inspirational huh...'
