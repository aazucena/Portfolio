We went to the club we both chose, and signed up for it. After that, we went out of the gym as the orientation now is over. As I am walking with Alex through the student hall, somebody accidentally bumped into me, and leaving me wondering what happened. It happened to be a feeble boy who’s about the height where my chin is.
