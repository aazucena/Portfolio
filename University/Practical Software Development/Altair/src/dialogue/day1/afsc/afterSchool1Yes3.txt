We sit at the back of the bus, and I text Ma that I will be not at home for a while as I am invited by my new friend Alex from the school orientation. We waited till we are at the central bus stop where most buses gather to get off to wander around downtown. Alex shows me many places like the famous Benjamin’s Restaurant, malls, arcade, karaoke bar, brand stores, and a museum. We went all around these place, then we stop by a fastfood place W&A to eat for snacks.
