Alex gave me a tour around the whole school. It surprised me so much that all facilities are provided for thousands of students. They have a big workout gym, swimming pool, martial arts facility, grand orchestra room, and a big blast of a cafeteria that also looks like a restaurant. Man as if I am living in a dream or maybe it’s a game to me...
