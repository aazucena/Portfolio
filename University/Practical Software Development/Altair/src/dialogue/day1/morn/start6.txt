At the front of the school gate, I waved Ma goodbye for today before entering there. I shake a bit when I am  walking to the entrance, squeezing through thousands of students. As I got to the comfortable space, I ended up in the huge main student hallway, and I was called by one of the Student Orientation volunteers, and they gave me the pamphlet which have information about the school, time of events, and tour times. They led me to the open gym where the school assembly will commence ten minutes on 8.
