I grazed through my new house quickly throughout my house to prepare myself to go to the orientation which starts apparently at 7:00 AM. I realized that my Pa is not at home as he already went to work at the early morning for his first day on the job. As I was about to prepare my school stuff, Ma already prepared with it easily since I am an only child in the family.
