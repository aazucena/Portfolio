I start going to my very first day at Gym Class. I am introduced to Mrs. Bullock, and I learned that shec coaches for all sports teams in this school, and have a lot of records wining the finals. She won consecutively best coach awards in the Canadian Highschool Division, and she is widely consider to be one of the best. So the pressure is on me to listen to her, and do what I can to get good grades on my gym class.
