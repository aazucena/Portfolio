So I went to the cafeteria, and grab some of the food there. And I see Alex, and signals me that he's available to sit with. I sit where the table he occupies. Looking at his food, he got the food from McDonald's with the Big Mac, Large Fries, and orange juice on from what I guess his mom prepared for him. I am really thinking to eat those fries, because in my opinion they look tasty. I feel the urge to steal them...
