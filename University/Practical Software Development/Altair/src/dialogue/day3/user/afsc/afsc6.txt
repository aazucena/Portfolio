I decide to read the book that my dad encouraged to me to take a look at. The book is autobiography of a famous, rich person. Reading the book, I learn about how their charisma affects everyone, and how their decision making impact themselves and around as a whole to become. After rading that, I feel inspired to be persuasive, and learn how to build a charming attitude towards my peers.
