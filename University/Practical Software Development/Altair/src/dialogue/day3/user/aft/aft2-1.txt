I start listening to her lecture, but the contents, and her way of teaching is so boring. Mrs. Fishsticks is basically teaching us with PowerPoint, and textbook as she is lazy to try hard to teach herself. I have a feeling that the PowerPoint does more of the teaching than her. She mostly explains in this way.
