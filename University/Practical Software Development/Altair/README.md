# Youth.txt
## Introduction
> “\*Whoosh\* You are a young man/woman in highschool. The modern world
has been hard on you
and you have had to transfer into a new school on your last year of
highschool. This is your last chance to
make the most of your precious youth before it is all gone in 20XX. Get
good grades, make friends, and
find romance the sky is the limit. However anything can happen at school
and your choices may lead to a
fulfilling life or a bleak future.”

That is our summary story of our game called Youth.txt. It is a slice of
life-esque, role-playing,
dialogue-based game that involves social simulation scenarios throughout
each day(turn) in order for the
created character to become the ‘perfect’ student against time
management. It also incorporates a touch of
dating simulation, trivia, and non-fictional lifestyle as the game is
set on a modern setting, adding the
real-life atmosphere to the game.

## Installation
The programmers at Altair have offered multiple ways for users to
install Youth.txt. This section will go
over the two ways to operate Youth.txt. The first way is to download
codeblocks version 17.12. Below are
detailed instructions on how to accomplish this goal.
1. Open up a browser and type [www.google.ca](http://www.google.ca/) in
the URL address bar.
2. We will now put codeblocks download in the search section

3. Proceed by selecting the first search result. This should be
“Downloads-Code::Blocks” at
[http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/)
4. We will continue by selecting the “Download the binary release”
5. For simplicity we will be selecting the
“codeblocks-17.12mingw-setup.exe from sourceforge.net
6. Finally we follow the installation wizard for completion
The second installation is for the unix environment.
7. Go to the path that the game is stored. For me this would be the
following Downloads/Altair
8. Now just type in the command `make compile`

## About the Programmers
**Aldrin Azucena**, **William "Billy" Hughson**, **Brian Cruz** came together to form
Altair. Each individual is currently
post-diploma transfer students for an assortment of colleges from across
Alberta. While attending the
University of Lethbridge each student was enrolled in Practical Software
Development. This course
required team Altair to construct a text-based adventure game.
Therefore, the resulting project resulted in
the construction of Youth.txt.


#Basic commands

Command | Example | Description
--- | --- | ---
**`[ENTER]`** | *“Welcome to Team Altair’s game called youth.txt”* |The game is designed to give the player the ability to read the game a sentence at a time. The enter key will be used to move onto new sentences.
**Choose Yes or No** | *“Do you want to go outside?”<br>“Yes”<br>“No”* |The game will have a lot of choices that will require theplayers input. It will print out the valid choices and the user will be required to select one of the choices to move on.




## New & Load Game
At the start of the game the player will be prompted with the following
sentence “To start either type
“1” for New Game or “2" for Load Game. Of course if you’re not feeling up to it you
can just say Exit”
1. If the user inputs New Game this will create a new game, and it will ask for your name, and gender. Then comes the tutorial.
2. If the user selects Load Game it will load the saved file. It will save player's events, stats, and **confidantes**

## Save Game
At the end of each turn the user will be prompted with a sentence asking
if they would like to save the game or not. If they choose yes this will save the game. If they choose
no the game will not be saved.

## Getting Hints
While in Youth.txt the user will be facing many problems. Therefore,
Altair has implemented the ability to get a hint on what the user should do. However, this is only offered
at certain sections of the game.
This is because we still want the user to experience the game and not be
dependant on the hints throughout the game.

## Quiting the game
The users will have the ability to quit the game by entering `[Ctrl-C]` or
typing in ‘3’ for exiting when prompted at the
beginning of the game

## End Note
Good luck student! We hope you choose well and study hard. We at Altair
have complete faith that you
will be able to conquer the school system.
