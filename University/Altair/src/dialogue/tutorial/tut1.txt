In my parentâ€™s car, how I will approach in my new life in this new city, while the parents are struggling to drive through the traffic. Looking out from the window, Calgary looks so busy every time as if it never stops at all. I really missed the small town I was raised for 18 years there, and I had so many friends back over. I really missed them, and I might cry if I think about it too much.
