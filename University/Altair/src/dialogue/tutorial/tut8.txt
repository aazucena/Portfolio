Dinner is done, and now I am on my way to the bed after I brushed my teeth, and groomed my non charismatic self. My parents told me that they will drop me to the school that I apparently don’t know the name, but soon to find out. Also they said that I should try to make friends, join the club, and get a good overall grade by importantly $emp. Sounds like it’s too much, but I think I can manage that.
