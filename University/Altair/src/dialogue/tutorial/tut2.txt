Finally out of the traffic, they reached downtown where it is full of people travelling on the sidewalk as if it is a school of fish. There are so many buildings that are ranged from attractions to restaurants. Seeing there is a very long line waiting for great food from the only, popular $location. I canâ€™t wait to eat at that restaurant soon.
