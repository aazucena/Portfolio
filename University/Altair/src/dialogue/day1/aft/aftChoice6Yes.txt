'I will be joining the Orchestra, me and my big brother joined in a French Horn lessons back in my hometown. I stopped playing it when I start at middle school, because I felt embarrassed about it. But my brother love playing it, and he is right now at Dalhousie University to become professional French Hornist. So I thought I should pick it up again as I am so inspired for his courage to play out many musical pieces for different bands around Canada. So now I am thinking to start playing it again, this time for fun.'
