Holding that consideration to my heart, I walked to my room pondering how will I pass through this school? There is a big drama, questionable teacher, and my time management. This school is the two faces of the same coin as it is wildly regarded highschool, but it's the most toxic it seems. Lots of things I have to handle. I wonder if I can survive. If I can get good grades, get in a relationship, or be a number one on this highschool. Is it worth for myself? It's as if I am playing a game of chance. I don't know what to expect. I'll let my life flow the way it is.
