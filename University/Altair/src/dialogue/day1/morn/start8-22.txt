'Hey, did you know that $char is going to teach 3rd year students. I am so not looking forward to that, she's so stupidly arrogant about us students whenever we don't pay attention to the class. I feel I need to skip these classes, because I would rather have an accident than go to one of her classes. I bet I am smarter than her, though.'
