'Hello Boys & Girls, welcome to Kal Garey High! My name is Mr. Anvik, and my first name ain’t mister though, it’s Doctor if you are curious. Anyway, I hope you kids are fun by hanging out on summer, and conversing them with Gen Z jokes to each other. You know in my days I like telling Dad jokes. Sometimes he laughs about it! Or I could tell a joke about pizza, but it's a little cheesy, because I am not good at baking these people with these crusty jokes as what you kids say these days. Anyways-'
