I started to sit down at the seat in the middle, and I patiently wait for the time the assembly starts. The principal walks towards the podium, and cough out for dramatic effect. And after waiting for the crowd mumbling to die down. I can see him from here when I am in the middle of the crowded students. Due to that, I can’t hear him because of the quiet chatter behind me, so I decided to eavesdrop on them.
