I started to sit down at the seat beside the gym door, and I patiently wait for the time the assembly starts. The principal walks towards the podium, and cough out for dramatic effect. And after waiting for the crowd mumbling to die down. Well I can’t hear from the principal, as I only can hear his name which is Principal Anvik. I feel so bored from the speech that I feel like I need to sleep, and so I did. I sleep throughout the time on that I don’t know anything at all about the information about the school.
