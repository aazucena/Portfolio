After Alex is done with the special, personal tour. We felt hungry, and decided to eat lunch that is provided by the school for free, since obviously it’s for the orientation. The food in this school is so bizarrely fancy as we are served with 3 michelin star food, meaning there are professional chefs serving here! Which normally doesn’t happen in any schools ever. Man I really want those food!!
