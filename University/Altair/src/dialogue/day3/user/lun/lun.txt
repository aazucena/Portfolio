So I went to the cafeteria, and I don't see Alex, and I am glad I got a break from that. So I sit down at an empty table by yourself. You start eating your ham sandwich Ma gave me, but the students beside my table calls me a peasent, because I am eating a ham sandwich. Should I ignore them or respond back?
