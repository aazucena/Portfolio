Overview
--
This is a warm-up exercise. It is intended to help with:
  * Refreshing your knowledge and skills from CPSC 2720.
  * Setting up your home environment with the tools needed for the course.
  * Practicing using the tools in your home environment.  

Problem
--
Create a program that computes the area and perimeter of a two-dimensional
geometric shape.

You are provided with one example to get started (`Octagon`).
Add another shape (student's choice!), including tests for it.


Where to Start
------------------
1. Set up your local development environment. The instructions are found at http://www.cs.uleth.ca/libcommon/Online_Resources/. The tools you will need are:
   * `Atom` configured for `GitLab`
   * A `C++` compiler
1. Fork this repository.
1. Clone your fork.
1. Add your shape to the program.

Notes
--
* You will not be able to compile the code locally unless you have `gtest` installed. Instead, your process will be:
   1. Write/Fix/Change your code.
   1. Commit your code.
   1. Push your code to `GitLab`
   1. Check the CI status.
      * Most likely it will fail, so check the log for the error messages.
   1. Repeat from #1.
